# Dynamic Binary & Source Code Analysis with LLM

This project provides a **dynamic code and binary security analysis framework** enhanced with **LLM reasoning**. It automates the extraction of indicators from binaries and source code, correlates findings, and produces a risk assessment.
For moment, the setup only tests how the logs are saved in the host machine, using bind mounts between container and virtual machine, and then virtfs between virtual machine and host.

### Currently issue
The issue i'm hitting with QEMU/KVM on WSL is that KVM requires hardware virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x/AMD-V) to be available to the Linux kernel, but WSL doesn't expose these to the guest Linux environment.
WSL itself is a virtualized environment: WSL2 runs Linux in a lightweight VM managed by Hyper-V. I am likely trying to run nested virtualization

## Usage

```bash
wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
qemu-img resize noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img +20G
cloud-localds seed.iso user-data.yaml meta-data.yaml
python3 ./script.py
```
